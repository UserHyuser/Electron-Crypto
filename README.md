## About program
### Intro
This was a lab study project so do not look for some good code here lol. Main idea was in crypto algs realisation by myself. BTW algoritms are located in one file ./src/functions.js I don't remember why I put all functions in just one file, but that's hilarious :D
Also all interface is in Russian

1. You can calculate hash and digital signature both to text and files (drag and drop file to form)
2. ./src/function - Main file with implementation of main crypto functions 
3. index.html - Main page of Electron app
4. ./Pages/ -  Contains pages of app with different algorithms 
 
## Compile and run
1. git clone
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run start`
4. Enjoy
